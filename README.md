# Randomy Stickers

Goal of this project is to calculate how much stickers should I buy to finish my Panini sticker album ?

# How to run it ?

    python2.7 main.py
    

Or directly with an IDE like PyCharm.  
  
    
# Output 


    Lowest iteration is :  649
    Biggest iteration is :  1698
    Average iteration is : 956.33 
    This means that you 'll need to get 956.33 packets and 4781.64 cards before having all the 683 cards
    It will cost you 860.70 €
    Average number of packets to buy : 38.45 
    This means that you will need to buy 38.45 packets so 192.27 cards but buy directly 490.74 cards
    It will cost you 157.29 €
    Average number of real packets to buy : 355.42 
    This means that you will need to buy 355.42 packets so 1777.11 cards but buy directly 50.00 cards
    It will cost you 332.38 €


    
# TODOs :

- Add logging
- Add configuration
- Optimization 



# Remark : 

Loop on 1000 is sufficient and gives same result than a bigger one.
